# Procrastinator

This is a project to create a device that would periodically move the mouse. 
It is a docking station, on which you can install the mouse and which would move a disk every 2 minutes, which creates the movement of the mouse cursor.
Implemented for the Logitech m705 mouse, but the basic ideas will work for other devices as well.


The project includes:
- model in fusion 360
- STL files for 3D printing
- sketch and circuit diagram for arduino nano (v.3)
- device photo

The ServoSmooth library was used in the arduino sketch. 
The author's page https://alexgyver.ru/servosmooth/ , the project itself https://github.com/AlexGyver/GyverLibs

To assemble the device you need:
-arduino nano v3
- A mini servo drive. I used an EMAX ES08MDII
- 2 resistors. 220 and 10K
- KLS KLS7-KW10-Z2PO45 DM3-03P microswitch (or same size)
- LED 5 mm
- 7pcs m2 6mm bolts
- 2pcs m2 8mm bolts
- 4pcs m3 6-8mm bolts with hidden cap
